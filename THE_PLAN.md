# Plan to Convert Indoor Mapping to an npm Package

## 1. Project Assessment

### Current State
- [x] Repository is structured as an indoor mapping library that was refactored to be a generic image manipulation library
- [x] Current name: "fabric-layers" (in package.json)
- [x] Using fabric-pure-browser 3.4.0
- [x] Has webpack and rollup configurations for building
- [x] Main entry point: src/Indoor.js
- [x] Build system configured for CommonJS, ESM, and UMD formats
- [x] Basic test infrastructure with Karma and Mocha

## 2. Package Configuration Updates

### Package Identity
- [x] Rename package from "indoorjs" to "fabric-layers"
- [x] Update package description to reflect new purpose as a fabric.js coordinate-plane (grid) & layers library
- [x] Update keywords to match new functionality (fabric.js, canvas, grid, coordinate-plane, layers)
- [x] Update repository, bugs, and homepage URLs

### Package Structure
- [x] Review and update main entry point in package.json
- [x] Add module field for ES modules support
- [ ] Add types field if TypeScript definitions are added
- [x] Set appropriate "files" array to include only necessary files
- [x] Properly mark fabric.js as a peer dependency
- [x] Add eventemitter2 as a direct dependency

### Build Configuration
- [x] Update webpack/rollup configuration to generate:
  - [x] CommonJS build (for Node.js/npm)
  - [x] ES module build (for modern bundlers)
  - [x] UMD build (for direct browser usage)
- [x] Configure external dependencies correctly
- [x] Set up source maps generation
- [x] Ensure tree-shaking friendly exports
- [x] Configure build scripts for development and production

## 3. Code Refactoring

### Architecture Adjustments
- [x] Ensure proper module exports for all components
- [x] Review and restructure entry points if needed
- [x] Update imports/exports to support tree-shaking
- [x] Refactor Floor -> ImageLayer for better clarity
- [x] Clean up and standardize event handling

### API Improvements
- [ ] Document public API interface focusing on coordinate-plane and layers functionality
- [x] Ensure consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- [x] Remove any indoor-specific code that wasn't already refactored
  - [x] Removed floorplan-specific code from Map.js
  - [x] Updated canvas IDs to use consistent naming
  - [x] Removed the floorplan directory
  - [x] Updated Indoor.js to remove floorplan exports
- [ ] Enhance grid system and layer management APIs
- [ ] Add TypeScript type definitions (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for all public methods
