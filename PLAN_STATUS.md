What Still Needs Work:

❌ Fix the remaining lint errors - We need to resolve the duplicate Grid declaration error and the trailing spaces in CanvasLayer.js.
❌ Complete module exports review - We should check all component directories (core, geometry, paint, etc.) to ensure their index.js files are properly structured for tree-shaking.
❌ Verify React hooks usage - We haven't examined any components to check if they're using React hooks and if those usages follow best practices.
❌ Finalize naming consistency - We should ensure consistent naming conventions across all components.
Other Relevant THE_PLAN.md Sections:
The completed items in THE_PLAN.md (marked with [x]) seem accurate:

Package identity changes
Package structure updates
Build configuration adjustments
We need to continue working on the Architecture Adjustments before moving on to API Improvements, Documentation, Testing, and Publishing steps.

Would you like me to continue fixing the remaining issues in the Architecture Adjustments section, or would you prefer to review any specific part of the implementation in more detail?
